          <p class="about__paragraph">
            In 2020, while many got into sourdough, I found a hobby making
            cocktails. Starting with the basics of an old fashioned, then moving
            on to a whiskey sour, craft cocktails became a skill that I enjoyed
            improving.
          </p>
          <p class="about__paragraph">
            After 10 years in the IT field, I found myself burnt out and in need
            of a something new. I was fortunate to turn a hobby into profession
            and start a career as a bartender. Now I want to share the fun of a
            great cocktail with you.
          </p>

            With that said, my name is Alberto. Let’s have a drink.
